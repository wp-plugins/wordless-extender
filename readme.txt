Wordless Extender is a starting point for everyone: list of commonly used plugins, wp-config.php / .htaccess configuration and security improvements.

== Description ==
![logo](http://welaika.github.com/wordless/assets/images/wordless-extender.png)

[Wordless](https://github.com/welaika/wordless) is the WP themes framework developed and used by [weLaika](http://dev.welaika.com) and a lot of other enthusiasts developers and contribuitors.

As we wrote in the Wordless README:

    « Wordless is not meant to be a bloated, all-included tool.
    This is why we recommend adding some other plugins
    to get the most out of your beautiful WP developer life »

*Wordless Extender* (WLE from now on) is a starting point for every Wordless theme.
Let\'s take a look in depth.

### Plugin Manager

Never change a winning team! These are our _starred_ plugins; with these we cover the 90% of our developing needs.
You\'ll have a control panel inside WLE to list, enable, disable and upgrade plugins from the collection; never search that useful plugin crawling the WP.org repo and have team kickstart projects with always the same plugin set.

### Config Constants

Manage WP constants (stored in your wp-config.php) directly within the WP backend.

We got inspired by WordPress [guidelines](http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php) and we crafted this little control panel. It is intended for advanced users: we are not interested in making things easy, but we\'d like to remember important/complex/abstruse settings and have them always just one click away.

Everytime you'll update these configs `wp-config.php` file will be backed-up in `wp-config.php.orig`. Keep in mind.

### Security fixes

This is the most important section: improving security.
Most of the tricks are directly from [Hardening Wordpress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress) guide; others are tricks discovered on battlefield.

You have to know what you are doing. Follow the comments in the panel if you are confused. Remind that when you\'ll let the plugin rewrite your `.htaccess` file, it will take a backup copy of the last version in `.htaccess.orig`.

If you are asking about the things are we doing with your `.htaccess` go read the template in `resources/htaccess.tpl`.
Essentially we\'ll block access to various files and locations.
We are always at work to improve this section, so if you have some tips open an issue or send a pull request.

### Wordless integration

WLE menu in the WP backend, will be integrated with the Wordless 0.4+ backend menu, creating _one place to rule them all!_
